# Marcin Augun - Where in the world?

## Description

This time I have created Where in the worls website based on one of the numerous challenges of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

Be sure to check out the demo for a firsthand look at this excellent tool for locating and learning about a particular country.

## Challenges

The Where in the World website allows users to:

 - See all countries from the API on the homepage
 - Search for a country using an input field
 - Filter countries by region
 - Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
 - Click through to the border countries on the detail page
 - Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## Check out the [Demo](https://marcin10lw.github.io/rest-countries-react/#/countries) ðŸ‘ˆ

As always this was an excellent learning opportunity in which I could improve making responsive websites using [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and working with API using React Query.
